        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Founded by passionate believers in the power of public speaking,
          MindLift was born from the realization that authentic stories have the
          power to change lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          We wanted to create more than just a video library ‚Äî a community, a
          movement, a shift in the way people learn, grow, and lead.
